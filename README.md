Small repository for my codes
Hi, I started coding during 2020's lockdonw so at the moment I', writing this I barely know pandas or numpy, but I wanted to create something. The first code is for GEM-2 Electromagnetic data analisation. Where I worked we use to use surfer for these data and is really fast and usefull. This code is just something I wanted to create to check how far I could get before continuing with more tutorials/courses. If you have any comment about how to improve fell free to contact me.
